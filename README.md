## Description

This repository aims to **document and summarize papers and repositories** in the fields of **embodied intelligence, human motion generation**, and related areas. It also provides **practical usage guidance** for the included resources.

- 📂 **Codes**: Contains implementations of common models, including **diffusion-based methods** and others, with usage examples.  
- 📂 **Datasets**: Includes commonly used datasets, preprocessing scripts, and models, along with instructions on how to use them.  
- 📂 **Papers**: Provides **survey summaries, paper reviews, and reproduction notes** to help understand the latest research trends and insights.

> ⚡ This repository is **continuously updated** with new papers, code, and datasets!


## News

- 📖 29 October 2025: **Provided a script that converts 272-dimensional motion representation (MotionStreamer) into SMPL-X parameters and visualizes it, and a script that converts 263-dimensional motion representation (HumanML3D) into global joint coordinates and visualizes it.[here](./Datasets/SMPLX/SMPLX_guide.md)**

- 📝 23 October 2025: **Human Motion Generation Survey (Ongoing 🔄). [here](./Papers/Survey_on_Human_Motion_Generation.md)**

- 📖 22 October 2025: **Provides an introduction to the SMPLX model and instructions for its use; follow the steps in the .ipynb notebook to run the code and visualize the results with Wid3D. [here](./Datasets/SMPLX/SMPLX_guide.md)**

- 🆕 22 October 2025: **The repository was established.**
