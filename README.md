## Description
description

<!-- *SMPL-X* (SMPL eXpressive) is a unified body model with shape parameters trained jointly for the
face, hands and body. *SMPL-X* uses standard vertex based linear blend skinning with learned corrective blend
shapes, has N = 10, 475 vertices and K = 54 joints,
which include joints for the neck, jaw, eyeballs and fingers. 
SMPL-X is defined by a function M(θ, β, ψ), where θ is the pose parameters, β the shape parameters and
ψ the facial expression parameters. -->
